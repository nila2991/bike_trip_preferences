# Business task:   
## How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?


# Description of the data

I used Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data for the last 12 months. After I combined all 12 files together and cleaned the data from personal information, I got a big data file, containing 5 779 444 rows and 9 columns:

- ride_id  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - special ride id number
- rideable_type &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - type of bike
- started_at &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; - start trip time
- ended_at &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - end trip time
- start_station_name &emsp;&emsp; - name of start trip station
- start_station_id &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - special id of start trip station
- end_station_name &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; - name of end trip station
- end_station_id &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - special id of end trip station
- member_casual &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - type of users



# Data preparation 

The most important for me was to figure out what's the difference in trips between membership holders and casual users.

First of all, I checked that there are only two types of membership (member or casual), as it is supposed to be.

Then I split the time data into several columns - such as day, month, and year - that provide more opportunities to aggregate the data.


## Some calculations 

I decided to add a calculated field for the length of the ride (in minutes) for future comparisons.

After that, I cleaned this data so it would be numeric (for future calculations) and credible.

Let's have a look at the mean, median, min, and max values of the trip's length.

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(all_trips_v2$ride_length_min)
```

But it is more informative for us to have a look at this information, divided by membership holders and casual users.

## Mean:


```{r echo=FALSE}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length_min ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
```

## Median

```{r echo=FALSE}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length_min ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
```
As we can see, in both cases (mean and median) casual users' rides are longer than membership holders'.

## Max

```{r echo=FALSE}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length_min ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
```

## Min

```{r echo=FALSE}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length_min ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)
```
```{r include=FALSE}
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length_min ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```


# Analysis

Let's prepare a small dataset for further analysis.

We will use information about the number of rides and average duration of trips per day of the week, grouped by our 2 categories: membership holders and casual users.

Let's have a look at our new dataset.

```{r include=FALSE}
casual_member_trips <- all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length_min)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday) 								# sorts

```

# Data subset

```{r echo=FALSE}
paged_table(casual_member_trips, options = list(rows.print = 15))
```

## Let's visualize the number of rides by rider type

```{r echo=FALSE}
casual_member_trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

## Visualization for the average duration (in minutes)

```{r echo=FALSE}
casual_member_trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```


## Total amount of time (total = average duration * number of rides, in hours)


```{r include=FALSE}
casual_member_trips$sum_ride_length <- casual_member_trips$average_duration * casual_member_trips$number_of_rides / 60
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
casual_member_trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = sum_ride_length, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

## Conclusions

During working days membership holders have twice more trips, but they are shorter than casual users' (also twice).

On weekends they have almost the same amount of trips, but casual users spend more time on each trip (2.5 times more).

If we look at the plot with summary duration for both categories, we can see, that on Monday-Friday membership holders and casual users spent the same amount of time on their trips.

But on Saturday-Sunday casual customers spend much more time (twice more) on their trips.

## New data subset

Let's prepare a new dataset.

We will also use information about the number of rides and average duration of trips, but this time we want to analyze changes during the year, grouped by our 2 categories: membership holders and casual users.

Let's have a look at our new dataset.

```{r include=FALSE}
casual_member_month_trips <- all_trips_v2 %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, month) %>%  #groups by usertype and month
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length_min)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, month)
```

## Data subset (for casual users)

```{r echo=FALSE}
paged_table(casual_member_month_trips %>% filter(member_casual == "casual"), options = list(rows.print = 25))
```
## Data subset (for membership holders)
```{r echo=FALSE}
paged_table(casual_member_month_trips %>% filter(member_casual == "member"), options = list(rows.print = 25))
```


## And let's have a look of our new plots 
Number of rides

```{r echo=FALSE}
casual_member_month_trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

## Average duration (in minutes) 


```{r echo=FALSE}
casual_member_month_trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

## Total amount of time (total = average duration * number of rides, in hours)

```{r include=FALSE}
casual_member_month_trips$sum_ride_length <- casual_member_month_trips$average_duration * casual_member_month_trips$number_of_rides / 60
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
casual_member_month_trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = sum_ride_length, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

## Conclusions

Statistics during the year look similar for both categories (they both have more trips in summer). 

But membership holders have more trips per month than casual riders, especially so in winter months (almost 3 times more).

But casual users' duration of trips is twice longer than membership holders' (in every month).

## Final dataset 

Finally, I decided to combine all my findings and prepare one dataset with information about our users, divided by months and type of day (weekday or weekend), so we can have a look at our results in one slide.

This time we need just information about the average trip duration because the number of rides and total trip time will not provide useful information.

```{r include=FALSE}
casual_member_year_trips <- all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, month, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and month
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length_min)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, month, weekday)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
casual_member_year_trips$weekday_weekend <- c(1:168)

for (i in casual_member_year_trips$weekday_weekend) {
  a = casual_member_year_trips$weekday[i]
  if (a == "Mon" | a == "Tue" | a == "Wed" | a == "Thu" | a == "Fri"){
     casual_member_year_trips$weekday_weekend[i] = "weekday"
  }
  else{
     casual_member_year_trips$weekday_weekend[i] = "weekend"
  }
}
```


```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
View(casual_member_year_trips)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
casual_member_year_trips_weekday_weekend <- casual_member_year_trips %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, month, weekday_weekend) %>%  #groups by usertype and month
  summarise(number_of_rides_new = sum(number_of_rides)				#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
            ,average_duration_new = mean(average_duration)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, month, weekday_weekend)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
View(casual_member_year_trips_weekday_weekend)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
casual_member_year_trips_weekday_weekend_new <- casual_member_year_trips_weekday_weekend %>% 
  unite("month_day_type", month, weekday_weekend, sep = " ")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
View(casual_member_year_trips_weekday_weekend_new)
```


## Average duration (in minutes)

```{r echo=FALSE}
casual_member_year_trips_weekday_weekend %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = average_duration_new, fill = weekday_weekend)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~member_casual)
```





```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
casual_member_year_trips_weekday_weekend_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month_day_type, y = average_duration_new, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

## Conclusions

Here we can see that casual users ride more on weekends during the whole year, and their rides increase in the summer period.

Membership holders on the other hand use bikes more stable during the whole year, regardless of the day of the week.


After all our analysis we can conclude that casual users are more likely to use bikes during their free time (since their trips are longer and mostly on weekends).

While membership holders use bikes as a transport to get to work or to the store (since their trips are shorter, but more regular every day during the whole year).

## Recommendations 

<span style="color: black;">I think it will be a great strategy to prepare a special membership option for only the weekend (for the whole year).</span>

<span style="color: black;">And returning to our year statistics, we can conclude, that the half-year membership (for the warm months: April-October) also would be a great decision.</span>
